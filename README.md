This project focuses on the design and implementation of a relational database schema for a student information system.

Key Features:

MySQL Implementation: Utilizes MySQL to create a robust and efficient database.

ERD Modeling: Employs an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually represent the database structure.

Manages Key Entities: Includes tables for students, courses, instructors, sections, and enrollments.

Project Components:

- Student DatabaseDesign.pdf: Detailed report outlining the design decisions, rationale, and considerations.
- Student Database Schema.sql: SQL script containing the CREATE TABLE statements for the database.
- ERD.png: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the database schema.
- GUI_Student_Database.py: Python file containing the GUI for interacting with the database.
