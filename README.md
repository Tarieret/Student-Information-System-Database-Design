# Student-Information-System-Database-Design
This project focused on designing a relational database schema for a student information system. I utilized MySQL to implement a robust schema that manages student, course, instructor, and enrollment data. I employed Entity-Relationship Modeling (ERD) to visualize the database structure and ensured data integrity through normalization and the implementation of primary and foreign key constraints.
